# Hausmix

Hausmix is a house management software designed for shared housemates and families. This initial implementation is targeted for housemates and shared chores.

Hausmix helps with scheduling chores and incentivising their completion through an innovative monetary reward system. The goal is to alleviate tensions and reduce conflict by having a flexible approach to chore management in shared homes. If your shared home is a mess, maybe it is time to mix in a new approach to how you keep your house tidy.

Mobile view of creating a chore and view of the mobile nav menu. A chore can be scheduled to repeat at various frequencies, or be a one time event.  Multiple users can be assigned to the same chore. A start date and deadline is set so the chore is not displayed until the start date has passed. If the deadline has passed, the chore is converted to an overdue status and anyone may complete the chore. The original assignee(s) then split the value evenly and owe the person who completed the chore that debt.
